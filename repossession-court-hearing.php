            <p>A Repossession Court Hearing  is the first stage where your case will be assessed by the Court.</p>

            <p>At this stage, you will have to come up with a solid case to convince the judge no to repossess your home.</p>

            <p>How does it work?</p>

            <p>If your lender no longer trust that you will be able to repay your mortgage, they will apply for a hearing to your local county court to repossess your home.</p>

            <p>This usually occurs when Homeowners reach between three and six months of mortgage payment arrears.</p>

            <h1 class="section-header text-bcg">How to Deal With Your Court Hearing?</h1>

            <p>Option 1: Don't go to your hearing</p>

            <p>Sometimes, under very specific circumstances,not attending a hearing can help you buy some time.</p>

            <p>By not showing up, the process can be suspended for 28 days but be careful, not showing up does not mean that your repossession or eviction will  be stopped!</p>

            <p>Your lender can (and most probably will)l apply again for your eviction or repossession.</p>

            <p>Option 2: Suspended Possession Order</p>

            <p>If it is proven that you are able to clear your arrears over a period of time, the judge can grant you a suspension possession order as long as you maintain the new payment plan.</p>

            <p>It is very important that this new payment is realistic. If you start 
missing payments, your lender will apply for another eviction order without notice</p>
