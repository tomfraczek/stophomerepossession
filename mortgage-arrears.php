            <p>You have mortgage arrears  when you have missed one or several payments of your mortgage.Those missing payments if not solved with your lender, can end up in repossession or eviction. </p>

            <p>We usually advice you to get in touch with your lender and try to solve the problem as soon as possible. In most cases Lenders will accept a suitable proposal to repay your arrears overtime.</p>
