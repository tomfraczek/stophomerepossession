            <p>An Eviction Notice is an Official Notice sent by a county court either by mail or in person to let you know about the time and date of your eviction. Homeowners can get between 2 weeks to 56 days’ notice. </p>

            <p>Even after receiving the eviction notice, it is still possible to stop it from happening.The sooner you contact us however, the easier it is for us to help you</p>

            <p>To stop the eviction, you will need to prepare your defence in front of the court. In order to do that, we can guide and give you advice tailored to your specific case.</p>

            <p class="section-tip">
            Tips: Never ever claim that you did not receive the eviction notice & never let things liger without doing anything. If you are elderly, have young children or are disabled, the legal system won’t show any sympathy for your situation.</p>

            <p>Option 1: Lender Negociation</p>

            <p>In most cases, we will advise you on how to reach an agreement with your lender. However, the procedure here depends on your lender and the urgency of your case.</p>

            <p>Option 2: N224 Application Notice</p>

            <p>If negotiations with your lender fail, we will then turn to legal action and help you complete a N244 Application Notice. This Application Notice will help you secure an emergency Court Hearing and give you the possibility to plaid your case.</p>

            <p>The level of defence depends on the history and complexity of your case, if your case requires more than just advice, we will then appoint you a solicitor to attend Court with you.</p>

            <p class="section-tip">Tips: Once your eviction has been stopped, your lender will not be able to remove you from your house. To keep it that way, it is very important that you follow what has been decided in Court.</p>
